# Project 3 --- Heat equation

This is Project 3 of the *Introduction to Applied Mathematics* course. In this project, one is required to solve a heat equation using prescribed methods.

To build the C extension of Python, which the C implementation of algorithms uses, one should set up the `setup.cfg` according to `setup.cfg.example`, and then run `make build`.

The command `make run` conducts all experiments in one turn and takes about 10 hours. The command `make plot` exports numerical results as PGF figures and LaTeX tables.
