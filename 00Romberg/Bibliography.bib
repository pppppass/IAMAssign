An explicit expression for the error is derived using Lagrange interpolation. From the general theory developed, several previous known results may be derived as special cases.},

A complete discussion, utilizing the known properties of the Bernoulli polynomials and their related periodic functions, is presented in the case of a repeated halving of the integration interval. The general expression for the error term is derived in the case of an arbitrary subdivision of the integration interval.},

	abstract = {Archimedes' hat-box theorem states that uniform measure on a sphere projects to uniform measure on an interval. This fact can be used to derive Simpson's rule. We present various constructions of, and lower bounds for, numerical cubature formulas using moment maps as a generalization of Archimedes' theorem. We realize some well-known cubature formulas on simplices as projections of spherical designs. We combine cubature formulas on simplices and tori to make new formulas on spheres. In particular, Sn admits a 7-cubature formula (and sometimes a 7-design) with O(n4) points. We establish a local lower bound on the density of a positive interior cubature formula on a simplex using the moment map.Along the way we establish other quadrature and cubature results of independent interest. For each t, we construct a lattice trigonometric (2t+1)-cubature formula in n dimensions with O(nt) points. We derive a variant of the Möller lower bound using vector bundles. And we show that Gaussian quadrature is very sharply locally optimal among positive quadrature formulas.},

	abstract = {A weighted quadrature formula is of Chebyshev type if it has equal coefficients and real (but not necessarily distinct) nodes. For a given weight function we study the set \$T(n, d)\$ consisting of all Chebyshev-type formulas with \$n\$ nodes and at least degree \$d\$. It is shown that in nonempty \$T(n, d)\$ there exist two special formulas having "extremal" properties. This result is used to prove uniqueness and further results for \$E\$-optimal Chebyshev-type formulas. For the weight function \$w {\textbackslash}equiv 1\$, numerical investigations are carried out for \$n {\textbackslash}leqslant 25\$.},
